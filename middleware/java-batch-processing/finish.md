Congratulations!  You just finished learning how to deploy and run your own Java batch application
 on OpenShift. Pretty simple isn't it?

## What's next?

Now you are probably interested in expanding your work with OpenShift in a less structured environment. You can start with setting up your own OpenShift environment if you haven't already or if you have maybe expanding on what you have learned to build your own Java EE batch applications. 
For hints and ideas of where to start next check out the resources below.
