This exercise demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize the [Micrometer Metrics extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/micrometer) specification through the SmallRye Metrics extension. You also consumed these metrics using a popular monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana.

There are many more possibilities for application metrics, and it's a useful way to not only gather metrics, but act on them through alerting and other features of the monitoring stack you may be using.
