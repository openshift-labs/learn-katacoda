This exercise demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize the [Micrometer Metrics](https://quarkus.io/guides/micrometer) extension to produce and observe metrics generated by the application.

[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) allows applications to gather various metrics and statistics that provide insights into what is happening inside the application. They serve to pinpoint issues, provide long term trend data for capacity planning and pro-active discovery of issues (e.g. disk usage growing without bounds). Metrics can also help those scheduling systems decide when to scale the application to run on more or fewer machines.

Micrometer defines a core library and a set of additional libraries that support different monitoring systems. Quarkus Micrometer extensions are structured similarly: quarkus-micrometer provides core micrometer support and runtime integration and other supporting Quarkus and Quarkiverse extensions bring in additional dependencies and requirements to support specific monitoring systems.
