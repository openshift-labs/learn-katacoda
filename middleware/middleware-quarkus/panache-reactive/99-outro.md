In this scenario, you learned about Quarkus and Hibernate Reactive with Panache, and how it can be used to create supersonic, subatomic Java applications with simplified Hibernate queries. Quarkus provides an effective solution for running Java in this new world of serverless, microservices, containers, Kubernetes, FaaS, and the cloud because it has been designed with these in mind.

Its container-first approach for cloud-native Java applications unifies imperative and reactive programming paradigms for microservices development and offers an extensible set of standards-based enterprise Java libraries and frameworks combined with extreme developer productivity that promises to revolutionize the way we develop in Java.
