In this scenario you will learn more about developing Spring Boot applications using the [Red Hat Runtimes](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes) platform. We will be building a simple Spring Boot application which produces messages to and consumes messages from a [Red Hat AMQ](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq) resource. AMQ provides fast, lightweight, and secure messaging for Internet-scale applications. AMQ components use industry-standard message protocols and support a wide range of programming languages and operating environments. AMQ gives you the strong foundation you need to build modern distributed applications.
