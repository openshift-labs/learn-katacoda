## Summary

In this workshop, you have worked with OpenShift Pipelines and learned about underlying Tekton concepts. OpenShift Pipelines provides CI/CD solutions for addressing the fundamentals of CI/CD (i.e., automation of building, testing, and deploying application components) but also offers modern solutions around addressing scale, server maintenance, and making all parts of the CI/CD process highly reusable for any number of application development tasks.

We hope you have found this workshop helpful in learning about OpenShift Pipelines and would love any feedback you have on ways to make it better! Feel free to open issues in this workshop’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openshift-labs/lab-tekton-pipelines), but also reach out to your workshop leaders to share any thoughts on how we can make this a better experience.
