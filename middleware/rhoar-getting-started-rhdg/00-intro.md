## Learning Objectives

This interactive tutorial shows you how to deploy and run a single instance of [RHDG](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid) Red Hat Data Grid on OpenShift.

You then learn how to expose the REST endpoint and invoke simple cache operations.

## Introduction to Red Hat Data Grid

Red Hat Data Grid (RHDG) is an open source, in-memory data store that:

* Stores data in memory (RAM) to provide fast, low-latency response times and very high throughput.
* Synchronizes data across multiple nodes for continuous availability, reliability, and elastic scalability.
* Offers flexibility. You can use it as a distributed cache, NoSQL database, or event broker.

RHDG capabilities improve application performance and scalability while reducing the need to make expensive calls to database management systems and transactional back ends.
