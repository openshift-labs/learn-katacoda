# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the [Prometheus API Client](https://github.com/AICoE/prometheus-api-client-python) for Python to collect and manipulate [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus#prometheus) time-series metric data. <br>
We will use a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to interact with a Prometheus instance which is currently being deployed. <br>
Please give the environment a couple of minutes to set up. <br>
Once the environment is ready to be used, you will see the links to access it in your workshop terminal.


### The Environment

During this tutorial you will be using a hosted OpenShift 4.7 environment that is created just for you. This environment is not shared with other users of the system. <br>
Your environment will only be active for a one hour period. Keep this in mind before embarking on getting through the content. <br>
Each time you start this tutorial, a new environment will be created on the fly.

Let's get started!
