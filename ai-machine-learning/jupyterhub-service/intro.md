The [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) web site describes Jupyter notebooks as:

> an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

Jupyter notebooks can be deployed direct to Linux, macOS or Windows environments, or in containerized environments such as Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift.

In this workshop you will learn how you can deploy JupyterHub, to create a service for providing Jupyter notebooks to multiple users at the same time.

The examples shown will make use of sample Jupyter notebook images, JupyterHub images, and templates, from the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project, a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be deployed to OpenShift.
