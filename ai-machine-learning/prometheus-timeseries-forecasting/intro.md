# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to train a machine learning model on [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus#prometheus) metrics to perform time series forecasting and predict anomalies.

We will use a [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) notebook to train a machine learning model on sample Prometheus time series metric data sets. We will be using the [Prometheus API Client](https://github.com/AICoE/prometheus-api-client-python) to collect and manipulate the time series data. Hence, we highly recommend you complete the [Prometheus API Client Tutorial](https://learn.openshift.com/ai-machine-learning/prometheus-api-client/) before starting this one! 

Once the environment is ready to be used, you will see the links to access it in your workshop terminal.


### The Environment

During this tutorial you will be using a hosted OpenShift 4.7 environment that is created just for you. This environment is not shared with other users of the system. <br>
Your environment will only be active for a one hour period. Keep this in mind before embarking on getting through the content. <br>
Each time you start this tutorial, a new environment will be created on the fly.

Let's get started!
