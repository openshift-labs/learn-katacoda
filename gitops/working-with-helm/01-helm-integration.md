Welcome! In this section we will be exploring the native Helm integration
within Argo CD.

## Background

Helm has become the defacto way of packaging up and deploying application
stacks on Kubernetes. You can think of Helm as sort of a package manager
for Kubernetes. The main components of Helm are:

* `Chart` a package consisting of related Kubernetes YAML files used to deploy something (Application/Application Stack/etc).
* `Repository` a place where Charts can be stored, shared and distributed.
* `Release` a specific instance of a Chart deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.

Helm works by the user providing parameters (most of the time via a YAML
file) against a Helm chart via the CLI. These parameters get injected
into the Helm template YAML to produce a consumable YAML that us deployed
to the Kubernetes cluster.

Argo CD has native support for Helm built in. You can directly
call a Helm chart repo and provide the values directly in the
[Application](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications)
manifest. Furthermore, you can interact and manage the Helm release on
your cluster directly with Argo CD via the UI or the CLI.

In this scenario, we will explore how to deploy a Helm chart using the
native integration in Argo CD.

## Exploring Manifests

You can specify your Helm repo, chart, and values directly in the
`Application` manfiest for Argo CD. Let's take a look at the example
we're going to deploy. `openshift-gitops-examples/components/applications/quarkus-app.yaml`{{open}}

This `Application` deploys a sample Quarkus application. If you take
a look at the file, you can see the specific configuration under
`.spec.source.helm`. Let's take a look at this section/snippet of
the YAML:

```yaml
spec:
  source:
    helm:
      parameters:
        - name: build.enabled
          value: "false"
        - name: deploy.route.tls.enabled
          value: "true"
        - name: image.name
          value: quay.io/ablock/gitops-helm-quarkus
    chart: quarkus
    repoURL: https://redhat-developer.github.io/redhat-helm-charts
    targetRevision: 0.0.3
```

Let's break this `.spec.source.helm` section down a bit:

* `parameters` - This section is where you'll enter the parameters you want to pass to the Helm chart. These are the same values that you'd have in your `Values.yaml` file.
* `chart` - This is the name of the chart you want to deploy from the Helm Repository.
* `repoURL` - This is the URL of the Helm Repository.
* `targetRevision` - This is the version of the chart you want to deploy.

This can be used to deploy the Helm chart on to your cluster, which is like using `helm install ...`.

## Deploying The Application

Before we deploy this application, make sure you've opened the Argo CD
Web Console.

To get to the Argo CD Web UI; click the [Argo CD Web Console](https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com) tab.

Once you have accepted the self signed certificate, you should be
presented with the Argo CD login screen.

![ArgoCD Login](../../assets/gitops/argocd-login.png)

You can login with the following
* **Username:** ``admin``{{copy}}
* **Password:** `oc extract secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops --to=-`{{execute}}

Apply the Argo CD `Application` manifest to get this Helm chart deployed.

`oc apply -f ~/resources/openshift-gitops-examples/components/applications/quarkus-app.yaml`{{execute}}

This should create the `quarkus-app` application. Note the Helm icon
âŽˆ denoting it's a Helm application.

![quarkus-app](../../assets/gitops/quarkus-app.png)

Clicking on this "card" will take you to the application overview
page. Clicking on "show hidden resources" should expand the "tree"
view.

![quarkus-app-tree](../../assets/gitops/quarkus-app-tree.png)

Grab the URL by running the following command: `oc get route/quarkus-app -n demo  -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'`{{execute}}

If you visit [that URL](https://quarkus-app-demo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com), you should see the following page.

You can now interact with this `Application` using the `argocd` CLI. For instance; if I want to change the scale of my application to 2 replicas, I just modify that value using the `argocd` CLI.

First, check to see how many pods you have running: `oc get pods -n demo`{{execute}}

The output should look like this.

```shell
NAME                           READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
quarkus-app-58f475cb86-rddz2   1/1     Running             0          14m
```

Now, modfy the Helm values: `argocd app set quarkus-app -p deploy.replicas=2`{{execute}}

You should now have 2 pods for this `Application`: `oc get pods -n demo`{{execute}}

There will now be two pods.

```shell
NAME                           READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
quarkus-app-58f475cb86-rddz2   1/1     Running             0          15m
quarkus-app-58f475cb86-s9llq   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          1s
```

The Argo CD UI should show the application with 2 pods and fully healthy/in sync.

This is a valid, and completely supported way of deploying your Helm
charts using Argo CD. But this isn't GitOps friendly. Lets see how we
can use Helm in a GitOps workflow.

Keep the Argo CD WebUI tab open for the next exercise, where we'll
explore a more GitOps friendly way of deploying Helm charts.
