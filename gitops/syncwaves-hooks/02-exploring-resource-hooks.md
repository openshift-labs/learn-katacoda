Now that you're familiar with syncwaves, we can begin exploring applying
manifests in phases using `resource hooks`.

## Background

Controlling your sync operation can be futher redefined by using
hooks. These hooks can run before, during, and after a sync
operation. These hooks are:

* **PreSync** - Runs before the sync operation. This can be something like a database backup before a schema change
* **Sync** - Runs after `PreSync` has successfully ran. This will run alongside your normal manifesets.
* **PostSync** - Runs after `Sync` has ran successfully. This can be something like a Slack message or an email notification.
* **SyncFail** - Runs if the `Sync` operation as failed. This is also used to send notifications or do other evasive actions.

To enable a sync, annotate the specific object manfiest with
`argocd.argoproj.io/hook` with the type of sync you want to use for that
resource. For example, if I wanted to use the `PreSync` hook:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
```

You can also have the hooks be deleted after a successful/unsuccessful run.

* **HookSucceeded** - The resouce will be deleted after it has succeeded.
* **HookFailed** - The resource will be deleted if it has failed.
* **BeforeHookCreation** - The resource will be deleted before a new one is created (when a new sync is triggered).

You can apply these with the `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy`
annotation. For example

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded
```

> **NOTE** Since a sync can fail in any phase, you can come to a situation where the application never reports healthy!

Although hooks can be any resource, they are usually Pods and/or Jobs.

To read more about resource hooks, consult the [official documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks)

## Exploring Manifests

I will be adding the following manifest to the first
application deployed. Take a look at the manfiest
`openshift-gitops-examples/apps/welcome-php/overlays/hooks/welcome-php-presync-job.yaml`{{open}}

You'll see that I have the annotation `argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync`
set. This means that this Job will run in the `PreSync` phase, before
the application of the manifests in the `Sync` phase.

> **NOTE** Since I don't have a deletion policy, this job will "stick around" after completion.

## Deploying The Application

This sample will be using `kustomize` to create a new application based
on the one we previously deployed; while adding the `Job`
with the resource hook. You can see this by [visiting the repo](https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/tree/main/apps/welcome-php/overlays/hooks)

Taking a look at the manifest file `openshift-gitops-examples/components/applications/welcome-hooks.yaml`{{open}}
will show that this will deploy the application in the `welcome-hooks`
namespace.

Create this application `oc apply -f ~/resources/openshift-gitops-examples/components/applications/welcome-hooks.yaml`{{execute}}

On the Argo CD WebUI, you should see another application appear.

Clicking on this "card" should take you over to the tree view.

![hooks-tree](../../assets/gitops/hooks-tree.png)

Observe the sync process. You will see that the `PreSync` manifest has
an anchor icon âš“ . You will also notice that the other manifests don't
start applying until the `PreSync` Job is done.

Once the application is fully synced. Take a look at the pods and jobs in
the namespace: `oc get pods,jobs -n welcome-hooks`{{execute}}

You should see that the Job is finished, but still there.

```shell
NAME                               READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pod/welcome-php-6986bd99c4-7w7qk   1/1     Running     0          2m43s
pod/welcome-presyncjob-l9h8n       0/1     Completed   0          3m14s

NAME                           COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
job.batch/welcome-presyncjob   1/1           30s        3m14s
```

Keep this tab open, in the next exercise. We will see how to use Syncwaves
and Hooks in tandem!
