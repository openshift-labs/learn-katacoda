This is a playground for trying out OpenShift 4.2. From here you can play
with OpenShift using the web console or command line.

## What are playgrounds?

Playgrounds give you a pre-configured environment to start playing and
exploring using an unstructured learning approach. They are great for
experimenting with OpenShift, including trying to deploy your own
application code.

The playground will be available for 60 minutes after which time it will
be destroyed.
