Before you get started we recommend reading the following tips. They explain
a bit about how the playground environment is setup and what access you have.

## Logging in to the Cluster via Dashboard

Click the [Console](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com) tab to open the dashboard. 

You will then able able to login with admin permissions with:

* **Username:** ``admin``{{copy}}
* **Password:** ``admin``{{copy}}

Or as a standard user with:

* **Username:** ``developer``{{copy}}
* **Password:** ``developer``{{copy}}

## Logging in to the Cluster via CLI

When the OpenShift playground is created you will be logged in initially as
a cluster admin (`oc whoami`{{execute}}) on the command line. This will allow you to perform
operations which would normally be performed by a cluster admin.

Before creating any applications, it is recommended you login as a distinct
user. This will be required if you want to log in to the web console and
use it.

To login to the OpenShift cluster from the _Terminal_ run:

``oc login -u developer -p developer``{{execute}}

This will log you in using the credentials:

* **Username:** ``developer``
* **Password:** ``developer``

Use the same credentials to log into the web console.

In order that you can still run commands from the command line as a cluster
admin, the ``sudoer`` role has been enabled for the ``developer`` account.
To execute a command as a cluster admin use the ``--as system:admin`` option
to the command. For example:

``oc get projects --as system:admin``{{execute}}

## Creating your own Project

To create a new project called ``myproject`` run the command:

``oc new-project myproject``{{execute}}

You could instead create the project from the web console. If you do this,
to change to the project from the command line run the command:

``oc project myproject``{{execute}}

## Persistent Volume Claims

Persistent volumes have been pre-created in the playground environment.
These will be used if you make persistent volume claims for an application.
The volume sizes are defined as 100Gi each, however you are limited by how
much disk space the host running the OpenShift environment has, which is
much less.

To view the list of available persistent volumes you can run:

``oc get pv --as system:admin``{{execute}}

## Builder Images and Templates

The playground environment is pre-loaded with Source-to-Image (S2I) builders
for Java (Wildfly), Javascript (Node.JS), Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.
Templates are also available for MariaDB, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and
Redis.

You can see the list of what is available, and what versions, under _Add to
Project_ in the web console, or by running from the command line:

``oc new-app -L``{{execute}}

## Running Images as a Defined User

By default OpenShift prohibits images from running as the ``root`` user
or as a specified user. Instead, each project is assigned its own unique
range of user IDs that application images have to run as.

If you attempt to run an arbitrary image from an external image registry
such a Docker Hub, which is not built to best practices, or requires that
it be run as ``root``, it may not work as a result.

In order to run such an image, you will need to grant additional privileges
to the project you create to allow it to run an application image as any
user ID. This can be done by running the command:

``oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n myproject --as system:admin``{{execute}}
