## Goal

Explore OpenShift version 4.7.

## Concepts

* OpenShift Web Console
*`oc` command line tool
* OpenShift Projects and Applications
* Your applications on OpenShift

## Use case

You control an OpenShift cluster for one hour. You can deploy your own container image, or set up a pipeline to build your application from source, then monitor it with Prometheus as it runs. Use an Operator to deploy and manage a database backend for your web app.

This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
