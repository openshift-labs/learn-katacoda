Before we get started, you need to login and create a project in OpenShift
to work in.

To login to the OpenShift cluster used for this course from the _Terminal_,
run:

``oc login -u developer -p developer``{{execute}}

This will log you in using the credentials:

* **Username:** ``developer``
* **Password:** ``developer``

You should see the output:

```
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
```

To create a new project called ``myproject`` run the command:

``oc new-project myproject``{{execute}}

You should see output similar to:

```
Now using project "myproject" on server "https://openshift:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app django-psql-example

to build a new example application in Python. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node
```

We are not going to use the web console for this course, but if you want to check anything from the web console, switch to the _Console_ and  use the same credentials to login as you used above to login from the command line.
