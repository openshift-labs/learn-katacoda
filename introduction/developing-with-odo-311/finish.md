Congratulations! You just learned the basics of using the `odo` tool to manage application components on the OpenShift Container Platform.

## What's next?

We hope `odo` helps you conveniently access all the power OpenShift has to offer, and that these first steps leave you eager to learn more. https://learn.openshift.com has other tutorials from basic to advanced that offer a real cluster to learn on, just like this scenario. It's also easy to run your own OpenShift cluster locally or to leave infrastructure management to Red Hat experts by using a hosted OpenShift.
