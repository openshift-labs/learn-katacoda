**Note:** The next two subsections explain how the controller watches resources and how the reconcile loop is triggered. If youâ€™d like to skip this section, head to the deploy section to see how to run the operator.

```
cat controllers/memcached_controller.go
```{{execute}}

The `SetupWithManager()` function in `controllers/memcached_controller.go` specifies how the controller is built to watch a CR and other resources that are owned and managed by that controller.

<pre class="file">
import (
	...
	appsv1 "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"
	...
)

func (r *MemcachedReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
	return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
		For(&cachev1alpha1.Memcached{}).
		Owns(&appsv1.Deployment{}).
		Complete(r)
}
</pre>

The `NewControllerManagedBy()` provides a controller builder that allows various controller configurations.

`For(&cachev1alpha1.Memcached{})` specifies the Memcached type as the primary resource to watch. For each Memcached type Add/Update/Delete event the reconcile loop will be sent a reconcile `Request` (a namespace/name key) for that Memcached object.

`Owns(&appsv1.Deployment{})` specifies the Deployments type as the secondary resource to watch. For each Deployment type Add/Update/Delete event, the event handler will map each event to a reconcile Request for the owner of the Deployment. Which in this case is the Memcached object for which the Deployment was created.
