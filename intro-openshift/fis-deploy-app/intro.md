When using OpenShift there are a number of different ways you can add an application. The main methods are:

* Deploy an application from an existing Docker-formatted image.
* Build and deploy from source code contained in a Git repository using a Source-to-Image builder.
* Build and deploy from source code contained in a Git repository from a Dockerfile.

In this course you will learn how to deploy an application from source code contained in a Git repository using a Source-to-Image builder.

The example application which will be deployed is implemented using the Python programming language. You will learn how to deploy the application from the OpenShift web console, and from the command line using ``oc``.
