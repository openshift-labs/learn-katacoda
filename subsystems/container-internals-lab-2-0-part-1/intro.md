## Background
In this self-paced tutorial, you will gain a basic understanding of the moving parts that make up the typical container architecture.  This will cover container images, registries, hosts, and orchestration.

By the end of this lab you should be able to:
- Draw a diagram showing how the Linux kernel, services and daemons work together to create and deploy containers
- Internalize how the architecture of the kernel and supporting services affect security and performance
- Explain the API interactions of daemons and the host kernel to create isolated processes
- Understand the basics of why people move on to container orchestration
- Command the nomenclature necessary to technically discuss the basics of the single and multi-host toolchain

## Outline
- Container Images: made up of underlying operating system components like libraries and programming languages
- Container Registries: Fancy file servers that help users share container images
- Container Hosts: Includes Podman (or Docker) runtime, Systemd, runc, and Libcontainer
- Container Orchestration: Includes Kubernetes/OpenShift
