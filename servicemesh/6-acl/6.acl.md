# Access Control Lists

Access control lists set whitelists/blacklists to restrict communication.
They are a part of the policy management feature set that is provided by
Istio's Mixer, via various adapters.

:toc:

## What we will learn in this module
This module will provide instruction on how to configure whitelists and blacklists,
which control what services a service is able to access.

## Before Starting
You only need the `customer` Virtual Service and Gateway, but if you have the
`recommendation` Destination Rule from other exercises, that's OK:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc -n %username%-tutorial get istio-io
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
NAME                                           AGE
gateway.networking.istio.io/customer-gateway   3h16m

NAME                                          GATEWAYS             HOSTS   AGE
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]     3h16m

NAME                                                 HOST             AGE
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation   recommendation   36m
----

If you have any scripts running in the bottom terminal, make sure to click
there and then press ctrl+c to terminate them.

## Patience is Required
The access control rules take some time to be applied and reflected. Be patient here!

[#whitelist]
## Whitelist
Weâ€™ll create a whitelist on the preference service to only allow requests to
the recommendation service if the version is v1 or v3. Requests to the v2
version of the recommendation service will return a 404 Not Found HTTP error
code.

First, start generating traffic:

[source,bash,role#"execute-2"]
----
bash /opt/app-root/workshop/content/scripts/curl_customer_quiet.sh
----

You can also run the command below a couple times to see what the output from
the shell script above is like:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

You will see something like:

----
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '765d4bc49d-ddgg7': 2949
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '7679d466f8-2hwcd': 2950
----

Now create the whitelist:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc apply -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content//src/istiofiles/acl-whitelist.yml -n %username%-tutorial
----

The YAML you just created looks like:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: listchecker
metadata:
  name: preferencewhitelist
spec:
  overrides: ["v1", "v3"]
  blacklist: false
---
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: listentry
metadata:
  name: preferencesource
spec:
  value: destination.labels["version"]
---
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: rule
metadata:
  name: checktorecommendation
spec:
  match: destination.labels["app"] ## "recommendation"
  actions:
  - handler: preferencewhitelist.listchecker
    instances:
    - preferencesource.listentry
----

If you look at Kiali, you will notice that traffic is now making it to the v1
and v3 versions of the service, but 100% of the traffic to the v2 service is
being rejected with `403 Forbidden`.

You can use `curl` via a script to see the 403 error:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
bash /opt/app-root/workshop/content/scripts/curl_recommendation_args.sh v2
----

[#whitelist-cleanup]
## Cleanup

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc delete -n %username%-tutorial -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/acl-whitelist.yml
----

[#blacklist]
## Blacklist
Whereas whitelists allow communication only to the listed hosts, blacklists
deny traffic to the listed hosts. We'll demonstrate using a blacklist on
version 3 of the recomemendation service. Any requests to v3 will result in a
`403 Forbidden` HTTP error code.

If you have stopped previous load script, start it again.

[source,bash,role#"execute-2"]
----
bash /opt/app-root/workshop/content/scripts/curl_customer_quiet.sh
----

Run the below once or twice to see actual output:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

You will see something like:

----
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '765d4bc49d-ddgg7': 2953
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '6d4bf9cff8-5nvw2': 834
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '7679d466f8-2hwcd': 2954
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '765d4bc49d-ddgg7': 2954
----

You can see traffic is hitting all of the service versions.

*Note:* it can take several minutes for the deletion of the whitelist to propagate. If you don't see the above, double check that you deleted the whitelist and then create the blacklist anyway.

Now, create the blacklist:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc apply -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/acl-blacklist.yml -n %username%-tutorial
----

The blacklist YAML looks like the following:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: denier
metadata:
  name: denycustomerhandler
spec:
  status:
    code: 7
    message: Not allowed
---
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: checknothing
metadata:
  name: denycustomerrequests
spec:
---
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: rule
metadata:
  name: denycustomer
spec:
  match: source.labels["app"]##"preference" && destination.labels["app"] ## "recommendation"  && destination.labels["version"] ## "v3"
  actions:
  - handler: denycustomerhandler.denier
    instances: [ denycustomerrequests.checknothing ]
----

Eventually, if you look at Kiali, you can now see that requests to the v3 version of the
service are failing:

image::images/blacklist_v3_blocked.png[]

// TODO: add some kind of curl to demonstrate the 4xx

You can also see this from the command line:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

You'll see only `v1` and `v2`:

----
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '556d799fbf-rbcpt': 2381
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7dbd669545-hzp4x': 5130
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '556d799fbf-rbcpt': 2382
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7dbd669545-hzp4x': 5131
----

[#blacklist-cleanup]
## Cleanup

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc delete -n %username%-tutorial -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/acl-blacklist.yml
----
