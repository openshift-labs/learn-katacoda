# Authentication with JWT and RBAC
In addition to enforcing security with mutual TLS, Red Hat OpenShift Service
Mesh can also perform origin authentication, or _end-user authentication_ at
the request level using JSON Web Token (JWT).

## What we will learn in this module
In this module, we are going to see how to enable authenticating end users
with the Service Mesh. We will also see how to use the Service Mesh
authorization feature to provide access control for services in the mesh.

## Before Starting
You only need the `customer` Virtual Service and Gateway, but if you have the
`recommendation` Destination Rule from other exercises, that's OK:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc -n %username%-tutorial get istio-io
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
NAME                                           AGE
gateway.networking.istio.io/customer-gateway   3h16m

NAME                                          GATEWAYS             HOSTS   AGE
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]     3h16m

NAME                                                 HOST             AGE
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation   recommendation   36m
----

If you have any scripts running in the bottom terminal, make sure to click
there and then press ctrl+c to terminate them.

[#enablingauthentication]
## Enabling User-End Authentication

Now it is time to enable end-user authentication.

The first thing you need to do is validate that it is possible to communicate
between all services without authentication.

Execute the following:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

You will see something like:

----
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7dbd669545-cwv9h': 704
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '556d799fbf-nc5cz': 705
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '69df5546f-vb9nb': 706
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7dbd669545-cwv9h': 705
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '556d799fbf-nc5cz': 706
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '69df5546f-vb9nb': 707
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7dbd669545-cwv9h': 706
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '556d799fbf-nc5cz': 707
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '69df5546f-vb9nb': 708
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7dbd669545-cwv9h': 707
----

Now we will add an end-user authentication policy. Take a look at the
authentication YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "jwt-example"
spec:
  targets:
  - name: customer
  origins:
  - jwt:
      issuer: "testing@secure.istio.io"
      jwksUri: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/security/tools/jwt/samples/jwks.json"
  principalBinding: USE_ORIGIN
---
----

And then run the following to deploy the policy:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc apply -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/policy-jwt.yaml -n %username%-tutorial
----

After about 1 minute, let's run the curl again:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

You will see:

----
Origin authentication failed.
----

If not, wait a few more moments and try again. If you want more details, run
the following:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
curl -sv http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}
----

You'll notice a `401 Unauthorized` error message. This is because the service
mesh is now enforcing authentication, and your curl is not authenticated (no valid JWT).

### Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose

* Namespace: %username%-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-auth-fail]
.Kiali Graph Authentication Failures
image::images/auth-fail.png[]

Note the 100% failure rate from the end-user (`istio-ingressgateway`) to the
customer service. You may need to execute the failed curl a bunch of times to
generate enough traffic for Kiali to display.

When we created the policy, it referenced an external origin. There is also a
token that goes with it. The following commands will fetch a valid token and
then use that token in the `Authorization` header of the curl request.
Execute it several times so that Kiali gets enough traffic to graph:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
TOKEN#$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/security/tools/jwt/samples/demo.jwt -s)
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $INGRESS_GATEWAY -s; done
----

And you will see something like:

----
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27103
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27140
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18439
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27104
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27141
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18440
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27105
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27142
----

### Kiali's Graph
If you look back at Kiali's graph, you will note the 100% success rate from
the authenticated end-user to customer. It may take a refresh cycle or two
before the errors from previous runs disappear:

[#cleanup]
### Clean Up

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc delete -n %username%-tutorial policy.authentication.istio.io/jwt-example
----

# Service Mesh Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

[#enabling-rbac]
## Enabling RBAC

`RbacConfig` objects are used to enable and configure Authorization in the
service mesh. Take a look at the following YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: RbacConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mode: 'ON_WITH_INCLUSION'
  inclusion:
    namespaces: ["%username%-tutorial"]
----

Run this command to deploy the RBAC:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
sed "s/CHANGEIT/$JUPYTERHUB_USER-tutorial/" /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/authorization-enable-rbac.yml | oc apply -n %username%-tutorial -f -
----

Now RBAC is enabled on your mesh. Wait a few moments and then run the curl to
test the RBAC:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----


You will see an error:

----
RBAC: access denied
----

For more specific details, execute one curl:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY} -sv
----

Notice that you get a `403 Forbidden` HTTP response.

### Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose:

* Namespace: %username%-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-rbac-fail]
.Kiali Graph Denied RBAC
image::images/auth-fail.png[]

Note the 100% failure rate due to denied RBAC

By default, Istio uses a _deny by default_ strategy, meaning that nothing is
permitted until you explicitly define access control policy to grant access
to any service. At this point we have enabled RBAC but we have no roles and
are not supplying any auth, so we are _denied by default_.

[#grant-access]
## Granting Access

Let's grant access to any user to any service of our mesh (`customer`,
`preference`, `recommendation`) only and only if the communication is an HTTP
`GET`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: service-viewer
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["*"]
    methods: ["GET"]
    constraints:
    - key: "destination.labels[app]"
      values: ["customer", "recommendation", "preference"]
---
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: bind-service-viewer
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "*"
  roleRef:
    kind: ServiceRole
    name: "service-viewer"
----

Note the _Service Role_ `service-viewer` is configured for all users (*) and
limits access to the GET method for the three services. This _Service Role_
object exists in your tutorial app's namespace, so its behavior is applied
there.

Run this command to deploy the role and role binding:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc apply -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy.yml -n %username%-tutorial
----

Wait a few moments and then send some requests by executing the following a few times:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

You will see something like:

----
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27224
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18522
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27187
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27225
customer #> preference #> recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18523
customer #> preference #> recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27188
customer #> preference #> recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27226
----

The communication now is possible. We aren't specifying a user, but no user
is "any" user, so it works.

### Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose:

* Namespace: %username%-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-rbac-success]
.Kiali Graph Allowed RBAC
image::images/kiali-graph-2.png[]

Note the 100% success rate.

[#cleanup]
## Clean Up

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc delete -n %username%-tutorial rbacconfig.rbac.istio.io/default servicerole.rbac.istio.io/service-viewer servicerolebinding.rbac.istio.io/bind-service-viewer
----

You will see something like:

----
servicerole.rbac.istio.io "service-viewer" deleted
servicerolebinding.rbac.istio.io "bind-service-viewer" deleted
rbacconfig.rbac.istio.io "default" deleted
----

# What we learned in this module
Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh provides the capability to authenticate
end-users via JWT and to enforce service RBAC. Kiali provides the mechanism
to visialize end-user authentication and RBAC failures.
