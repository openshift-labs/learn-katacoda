# Fault Injection

Chaos engineering involves intentionally designing failure into components to
ensure that the larger system is resilient. This can involve HTTP errors or
network delays or even killing components all together. Understanding failure
scenarios is a critical aspect of microservices architecture (aka distributed
computing). Istio provides mechanisms to perform fault injection.

## What we will learn in this module
This module will provide instruction on how to introduce service failures and
delays as a part of understanding, testing, and designing microservices.

## Before Starting
You only need the `customer` Virtual Service and Gateway, but if you have the
`recommendation` Destination Rule from other exercises, that's OK:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc -n %username%-tutorial get istio-io
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
NAME                                           AGE
gateway.networking.istio.io/customer-gateway   3h16m

NAME                                          GATEWAYS             HOSTS   AGE
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]     3h16m

NAME                                                 HOST             AGE
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation   recommendation   36m
----

If you have any scripts running in the bottom terminal, make sure to click
there and then press ctrl+c to terminate them.


[#503error]
## HTTP Error 503
In the absence of any traffic management policies or routing rules,
recommendation v1, v2 and v3 are being randomly load-balanced as that is the
default behavior in Service Mesh.

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc -n %username%-tutorial get pods -l app#recommendation
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
recommendation-v1-7fbb8f794-ngw58    2/2     Running   0          21h
recommendation-v2-77bc7bb94d-8wjxz   2/2     Running   0          17h
recommendation-v3-5786cd744d-96q79   2/2     Running   0          17h
----

Then, start running load in the background and bottom terminal:

[source,bash,role#"execute-2"]
----
bash /opt/app-root/workshop/content/scripts/curl_customer_quiet.sh
----

Go ahead and create a `DestinationRule` that will inject 503's for approximately 50% of the requests:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc apply -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-503.yml -n %username%-tutorial
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
----

The following is what you just configured:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  host: recommendation
  subsets:
  - labels:
      version: v1
    name: v1
  - labels:
      version: v2
    name: v2
  - labels:
      version: v3
    name: v3
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v1
      weight: 34
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v2
      weight: 33
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v3
      weight: 33
    fault:
      abort:
        percentage:
          value: 50
        httpStatus: 503
---
----

Note that this file creates 2 resources. First, a DestinationRule
`recommendation` with subsets for v1, v2, and v3 (which may have already
existed). Second, a VirtualService `recommendation` that splits traffic
equally between v1, v2, and v3 but also introduces a 503 fault for 50% of the
requests.

Execute the following a few times:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

Because Istio has built-in default retries, you are almost guaranteed to not
see the 503 failures at all. When the preference -> recommendation call fails
it will be retried by Istio three times. And, if other calls fail, they, too,
are retried. Thus there is a high probability that the client will not see a
failure but you will see that the failure rate is accurately reflected in the
Kiali console.

### Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose:

* Namespace: %username%-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-503]
.Kiali Graph Showing 503 Failures
image::images/503.png[]

Note the 50% failure rate from preference to recommendation. It will be
clearer if you click on the line between the two services.

### Clean up

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc delete -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-503.yml -n %username%-tutorial
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io "recommendation" deleted
virtualservice.networking.istio.io "recommendation" deleted
----

[#delay]
## Delay

The most insidious of possible distributed computing faults is not a "down"
service but a service that is responding slowly, potentially causing a
cascading failure in your network of services. To see how to inject such a
delay, take a look at the following YAML:

[source,yaml,subs#"+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  host: recommendation
  subsets:
  - labels:
      version: v1
    name: v1
  - labels:
      version: v2
    name: v2
  - labels:
      version: v3
    name: v3
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v1
      weight: 34
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v2
      weight: 33
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v3
      weight: 33
    fault:
      delay:
        fixedDelay: 7.000s
        percent: 50
---
----

Note that this file creates 2 resources. First, a DestinationRule
`recommendation` with subsets for v1, v2, and v3. Second, a VirtualService
`recommendation` that splits traffic equally between v1, v2, and v3 but also
introduces a 7s delay for 50% of the requests.

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc apply -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-delay.yml -n %username%-tutorial
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
----

You will notice that 50% of requests to the customer endpoint now have a
delay:

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY#$(oc get route -n %username%-smcp istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath#{.spec.host}')
for x in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://${INGRESS_GATEWAY}; done
----

### Kiali's Distributed Tracing

Within the Kiali UI select the *Distributed Tracing* option from the left
hand navigation and then choose:

* Namespace: %username%-tutorial
* Service: recommendation
* Lookback: Last 1m

and finally press the *Search* button.

[#img-503]
.Kiali Graph Showing Delays
image::images/delay.png[]

Note that 50% of the traces are slightly over the artificial 7s delay while
the other 50% are in the low ms range.

### Clean up

[source,bash,role#"execute-1"]
----
oc delete -f /opt/app-root/workshop/content/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-delay.yml -n %username%-tutorial
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io "recommendation" deleted
virtualservice.networking.istio.io "recommendation" deleted
----

## What we learned in this module
Istio provides a simple mechanism to simulate service and network
failures and delays to improve microservice testing and resiliency. Kiali
provides a rich console to visualize the service failure rates and service
delays.
